git clone  |    Create a local copy/clone from the repository

git branch 	|	Lists the different branches available for you to see
git branch (branch name)	|	Creates a new branch
git checkout -b <new-branch-name>	| Creates a new branch and checks it out in one commend (rather than running them seperately)

git reset --hard	|	Removes any changes you made to files that you do not want to add/commit
git status	|	Shows what files/commits if any are waiting to be added/commited
git add (filenames)	|	Add file to the staging area ready to commit - You can add a numer of files in one commit, or individualy

git diff  |    Git diff without arguments is comparing the working directory with the staging area
git diff --staged  |    Compare the staging area with the repository
git checkout master  |    Restore the "Head" to the latest check-in (this will be part of a later lesson/module)
git merge branch1 branch2  |    Merge two branches, branch2 get merged into branch1
git branch -d name  |    Remove the branch with the specified name
