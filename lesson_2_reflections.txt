1.) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- Initializing a git repo creates a place where you can start committing new versions of your files and tracking any changes that have been made, or bugs that have been introduced. You need to this for the same reason, to track any change made or to revert any bugs that may have been introduced by incorrect code.

Github commands

git diff  |    Git diff without arguments is comparing the working directory with the staging area
git diff --staged  |    Compare the staging area with the repository
git checkout master  |    Restore the "Head" to the latest check-in (this will be part of a later lesson/module)
git merge branch1 branch2  |    Merge two branches, branch2 get merged into branch1
git branch -d name  |    Remove the branch with the specified name
git show commitId  |    Show the changes made in this commit compared to the previous version. This is working even after merging.
